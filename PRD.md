# Product Requirements Document: To-Do List Application

**1. Introduction & Overview**
- **Project Name:** To-Do List App
- **Description:** A web application that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks efficiently. The application will feature a React-based frontend, a Node.js/Express backend REST API, and MongoDB for data storage.

**2. Goals & Objectives**
- To provide a simple and intuitive interface for task management.
- Users should be able to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.
- Ensure tasks are persistently stored and retrievable.
- Familiarize with and implement a full-stack application using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

**3. Target Audience**
- Individuals seeking a straightforward digital solution for managing personal tasks and to-do items.
- Developers learning full-stack web development.

**4. Features (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)**
- **Task Management:**
    - **Create Task:**
        - **User Story:** As a user, I want to add a new task with a title, an optional description, and an optional due date, so I can keep track of what I need to do.
        - **Expected Behavior:**
            - User can input a task title in a designated text field.
            - User can optionally input a task description in a separate text area.
            - User can optionally select a due date using a date picker.
            - Clicking an "Add Task" or similar button saves the task to the list and the database.
            - The input fields are cleared after a task is successfully added.
            - If the title is missing, or contains only whitespace, or exceeds a predefined reasonable length, an error message is displayed, and the task is not added.
            - Basic input sanitization is applied to the description to mitigate common risks (e.g., XSS) if it were to be rendered directly as HTML (though rendering method is TBD).
            - For MVP, duplicate task titles are allowed.
            - Due dates in the past are allowed; the UI may provide a visual cue if a date is in the past.
            - The system should handle rapid submissions (e.g., accidental double-clicks on "Add Task") gracefully, ideally creating only one task or clearly indicating if multiple were created due to multiple distinct requests.
    - **View Tasks:**
        - **User Story:** As a user, I want to see all my tasks in a list, showing the title and completion status, so I can quickly see what needs to be done and what's already finished.
        - **Expected Behavior:**
            - All tasks are displayed in a list format upon loading the application, ordered by creation date in reverse chronological order (newest first) by default.
            - Each task item clearly displays its title.
            - Each task item visually indicates its completion status (e.g., checkbox, strikethrough for completed tasks).
            - If there are no tasks, a message indicating an empty list is shown.
            - If fetching tasks from the backend fails, a user-friendly error message (e.g., "Could not load tasks. Please try again.") is displayed.
            - *Consideration for future iterations:* For a very large number of tasks, performance may degrade with the "load all" approach. Pagination or virtual scrolling should be considered for future improvements.
    - **Update Task:**
        - **User Story:** As a user, I want to edit the title, description, and due date of an existing task, so I can correct mistakes or update task details.
        - **Expected Behavior:**
            - User can initiate an edit mode for a specific task (e.g., by clicking an "Edit" button/icon).
            - In edit mode, the task's title, description, and due date become editable fields, pre-filled with current values.
            - User can modify the fields and save the changes.
            - Clicking a "Save" or similar button updates the task in the list and the database by sending all editable fields.
            - User can cancel the edit operation, reverting to the display mode without saving changes (client-side state reversion).
            - If the title is cleared, contains only whitespace, or exceeds a predefined reasonable length during an edit, an error message is displayed, and the change is not saved.
            - Attempting to initiate an edit or save an update for a task that no longer exists in the database (e.g., deleted in another session) should result in a user-friendly error message (e.g., "Task not found or has been deleted"), and the API should return an appropriate error code (e.g., 404 Not Found).
            - *MVP Concurrency Handling:* If concurrent edits to the same task occur, the last successfully saved edit will overwrite previous ones. More sophisticated conflict resolution is out of scope for MVP.
    - **Mark as Complete/Incomplete:**
        - **User Story:** As a user, I want to mark a task as complete or incomplete, so I can track my progress.
        - **Expected Behavior:**
            - User can toggle the completion status of a task (e.g., by clicking a checkbox or a "Mark Complete/Incomplete" button).
            - When a task is marked as complete, its appearance changes to visually distinguish it from incomplete tasks (e.g., strikethrough title, different background color).
            - When a task is marked as incomplete, it reverts to the appearance of an active task.
            - The change in completion status is reflected in the database.
    - **Delete Task:**
        - **User Story:** As a user, I want to delete a task I no longer need, so I can keep my to-do list clean.
        - **Expected Behavior:**
            - User can permanently remove a task from the list (e.g., by clicking a "Delete" button/icon).
            - A confirmation prompt may appear before deletion to prevent accidental removal (optional for MVP, but good practice).
            - Upon deletion, the task is removed from the displayed list and the database.
            - Attempting to delete a task that no longer exists should be handled gracefully by the UI (e.g., the task is simply removed if present, or no action if already gone) and the API (e.g., return a success or 404 status code).
- **User Interface (UI):**
    - Clean, minimalist design.
    - Input field for adding new tasks.
    - List display for tasks.
    - Controls (buttons/icons) for editing, deleting, and marking tasks as complete/incomplete.
- **Data Persistence:**
    - All tasks created by the user will be saved in the MongoDB database.
    - Task status and details will be retrieved from the database upon loading the application.

**5. Technical Specifications**
- **Frontend:** React
    - Component-based architecture.
    - State management (e.g., React Context API or a simple state management solution for MVP).
    - HTTP client (e.g., Axios or `fetch` API) for communicating with the backend.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
    - RESTful API endpoints for task operations:
        - `POST /tasks` - Create a new task
        - `GET /tasks` - Retrieve all tasks
        - `GET /tasks/:id` - Retrieve a single task (optional for MVP)
        - `PUT /tasks/:id` - Update an existing task (expects all editable fields)
        - `DELETE /tasks/:id` - Delete a task
    - JSON for request and response bodies.
    - API will implement consistent JSON error responses (e.g., `{ "status": "error", "message": "Detailed error message" }` or `{ "errors": ["message1", "message2"] }`) along with appropriate HTTP status codes.
    - Basic input sanitization will be performed on all incoming string data on the backend to mitigate common risks like XSS or NoSQL injection patterns, complementing client-side validation.
- **Database:** MongoDB
    - Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling) for interacting with MongoDB.
    - Task schema will include at least:
        - `title` (String, required, consider max length e.g., 255 chars)
        - `description` (String, optional, consider max length e.g., 1000 chars)
        - `dueDate` (Date, optional, stored in UTC)
        - `isCompleted` (Boolean, default: false)
- **Environment Variables:**
    - Configuration for database connection URI, server port, etc., will be managed through environment variables.

**5.1. Operational Considerations (MVP)**
- The application should handle temporary database connection issues gracefully. If the database is unavailable during an operation, an informative message should be displayed to the user (e.g., "Cannot connect to the database. Please try again later.").
- Loading indicators (e.g., spinners, disabled buttons) will be displayed in the UI during data fetching (e.g., loading tasks) and data submission operations (e.g., adding, updating, deleting a task) to provide visual feedback on system activity.
- Clear and timely success or failure feedback (e.g., toast notifications, inline messages) will be provided for all primary user actions (create, update, delete, mark complete/incomplete task).

**6. Success Metrics (Post-MVP)**
- Number of active users (if user accounts are implemented).
- Number of tasks created and completed.
- User feedback and satisfaction.

**7. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for MVP)**
- User Authentication & Authorization (e.g., using JWT).
- Task prioritization (e.g., high, medium, low).
- Task categories or tags.
- Due date reminders or notifications.
- Sorting and filtering tasks (e.g., by due date, completion status).
- Drag-and-drop reordering of tasks.
- Responsive design for mobile and tablet devices.
- User accounts and data isolation per user. 

**8. User Interface (UI) and Navigation Flow (MVP)**

The application will primarily function as a **Single Page Application (SPA)**. All core features will be accessible from a main dashboard view without traditional page reloads.

**I. Main Screen/Page: Task Dashboard**

This is the sole and central screen for the MVP. It will contain:

1.  **Header/App Title:**
    *   Displays the application name (e.g., "My To-Do List").
2.  **Task Input Area:**
    *   Text field for `Task Title` (required).
    *   Text area for `Task Description` (optional).
    *   Date picker for `Due Date` (optional).
    *   "Add Task" button.
3.  **Task List Area:**
    *   Displays existing tasks.
    *   If no tasks, shows a message like "Your to-do list is empty!" or "Add a task to get started!".
    *   Each task item in the list will display:
        *   Checkbox (or similar control) to mark as complete/incomplete.
        *   Task Title (strikethrough when complete).
        *   (Optional visibility for MVP) Description and Due Date.
        *   "Edit" button/icon.
        *   "Delete" button/icon.

        *   **On Success:** Task's visual appearance updates, success notification.
        *   **On Failure:** Error message, task appearance ideally reverts or shows failure.

5.  **Editing a Task:**
    *   **Flow:** User clicks "Edit" on a task.
    *   **Screen State / Transitions (Inline Edit):**
        *   Selected task transforms into an editable form (inputs for Title, Description, Due Date pre-filled).
        *   "Save" and "Cancel" buttons appear.
        *   (Alternative: Modal dialog for editing).
    *   **Sub-flow: Saving Edits:**
        *   User modifies details, clicks "Save."
        *   API call to `PUT /tasks/:id`.
        *   **On Success:** Task item updates, reverts to view-only, success notification.
        *   **On Failure:** Error message in form/modal, form remains editable.
    *   **Sub-flow: Canceling Edits:**
        *   User clicks "Cancel."
        *   Form reverts to view-only task display. No API call.

6.  **Deleting a Task:**
    *   **Flow:** User clicks "Delete" on a task; (Optional) confirms deletion.
    *   **Screen State / Transitions:**
        *   Loading indicator may appear on the task item.

**8.1. UI Component Suggestions (for Task Dashboard)**

These suggestions align with a React-based frontend and the "clean, minimalist design" goal.

1.  **Overall Page Structure:**
    *   **Main Container:** Root `div` (e.g., `<div className="app-container">`).
    *   **Layout:** CSS Flexbox or Grid for arranging main sections.

2.  **Header/App Title:**
    *   **Component:** Simple text display.
    *   **HTML Semantics:** `<header>` containing an `<h1>` or `<h2>` (e.g., `<header className="app-header"><h1>My To-Do List</h1></header>`).

3.  **Task Input Area:**
    *   **Form Element:** `<form>` to wrap inputs and button (e.g., `<form onSubmit={handleAddTask} className="task-input-form">`).
    *   **Task Title Input:**
        *   **Component:** Text Input Field with `<label>`.
        *   **HTML Semantics:** `<input type="text" id="taskTitle" placeholder="What needs to be done?">`.
