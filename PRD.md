# Product Requirements Document: To-Do List Application

**1. Introduction & Overview**
- **Project Name:** To-Do List App
- **Description:** A web application that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks efficiently. The application will feature a React-based frontend, a Node.js/Express backend REST API, and MongoDB for data storage.

**2. Goals & Objectives**
- To provide a simple and intuitive interface for task management.
- Users should be able to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.
- Ensure tasks are persistently stored and retrievable.
- Familiarize with and implement a full-stack application using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

**3. Target Audience**
- Individuals seeking a straightforward digital solution for managing personal tasks and to-do items.
- Developers learning full-stack web development.

**4. Features (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)**
- **Task Management:**
    - **Create Task:**
        - **User Story:** As a user, I want to add a new task with a title, an optional description, and an optional due date, so I can keep track of what I need to do.
        - **Expected Behavior:**
            - User can input a task title in a designated text field.
            - User can optionally input a task description in a separate text area.
            - User can optionally select a due date using a date picker.
            - Clicking an "Add Task" or similar button saves the task to the list and the database.
            - The input fields are cleared after a task is successfully added.
            - If the title is missing, an error message is displayed, and the task is not added.
    - **View Tasks:**
        - **User Story:** As a user, I want to see all my tasks in a list, showing the title and completion status, so I can quickly see what needs to be done and what's already finished.
        - **Expected Behavior:**
            - All tasks are displayed in a list format upon loading the application.
            - Each task item clearly displays its title.
            - Each task item visually indicates its completion status (e.g., checkbox, strikethrough for completed tasks).
            - If there are no tasks, a message indicating an empty list is shown.
    - **Update Task:**
        - **User Story:** As a user, I want to edit the title, description, and due date of an existing task, so I can correct mistakes or update task details.
        - **Expected Behavior:**
            - User can initiate an edit mode for a specific task (e.g., by clicking an "Edit" button/icon).
            - In edit mode, the task's title, description, and due date become editable fields, pre-filled with current values.
            - User can modify the fields and save the changes.
            - Clicking a "Save" or similar button updates the task in the list and the database.
            - User can cancel the edit operation, reverting to the display mode without saving changes.
            - If the title is cleared during an edit, an error message is displayed, and the change is not saved.
    - **Mark as Complete/Incomplete:**
        - **User Story:** As a user, I want to mark a task as complete or incomplete, so I can track my progress.
        - **Expected Behavior:**
            - User can toggle the completion status of a task (e.g., by clicking a checkbox or a "Mark Complete/Incomplete" button).
            - When a task is marked as complete, its appearance changes to visually distinguish it from incomplete tasks (e.g., strikethrough title, different background color).
            - When a task is marked as incomplete, it reverts to the appearance of an active task.
            - The change in completion status is reflected in the database.
    - **Delete Task:**
        - **User Story:** As a user, I want to delete a task I no longer need, so I can keep my to-do list clean.
        - **Expected Behavior:**
            - User can permanently remove a task from the list (e.g., by clicking a "Delete" button/icon).
            - A confirmation prompt may appear before deletion to prevent accidental removal (optional for MVP, but good practice).
            - Upon deletion, the task is removed from the displayed list and the database.
- **User Interface (UI):**
    - Clean, minimalist design.
    - Input field for adding new tasks.
    - List display for tasks.
    - Controls (buttons/icons) for editing, deleting, and marking tasks as complete/incomplete.
- **Data Persistence:**
    - All tasks created by the user will be saved in the MongoDB database.
    - Task status and details will be retrieved from the database upon loading the application.

**5. Technical Specifications**
- **Frontend:** React
    - Component-based architecture.
    - State management (e.g., React Context API or a simple state management solution for MVP).
    - HTTP client (e.g., Axios or `fetch` API) for communicating with the backend.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
    - RESTful API endpoints for task operations:
        - `POST /tasks` - Create a new task
        - `GET /tasks` - Retrieve all tasks
        - `GET /tasks/:id` - Retrieve a single task (optional for MVP)
        - `PUT /tasks/:id` - Update an existing task
        - `DELETE /tasks/:id` - Delete a task
    - JSON for request and response bodies.
- **Database:** MongoDB
    - Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling) for interacting with MongoDB.
    - Task schema will include at least:
        - `title` (String, required)
        - `description` (String, optional)
        - `dueDate` (Date, optional)
        - `isCompleted` (Boolean, default: false)
- **Environment Variables:**
    - Configuration for database connection URI, server port, etc., will be managed through environment variables.

**6. Success Metrics (Post-MVP)**
- Number of active users (if user accounts are implemented).
- Number of tasks created and completed.
- User feedback and satisfaction.

**7. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for MVP)**
- User Authentication & Authorization (e.g., using JWT).
- Task prioritization (e.g., high, medium, low).
- Task categories or tags.
- Due date reminders or notifications.
- Sorting and filtering tasks (e.g., by due date, completion status).
- Drag-and-drop reordering of tasks.
- Responsive design for mobile and tablet devices.
- User accounts and data isolation per user.
