# Product Requirements Document: To-Do List Application

**1. Introduction & Overview**
- **Project Name:** To-Do List App
- **Description:** A web application that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks efficiently. The application will feature a React-based frontend, a Node.js/Express backend REST API, and MongoDB for data storage.

**2. Goals & Objectives**
- To provide a simple and intuitive interface for task management.
- Users should be able to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.
- Ensure tasks are persistently stored and retrievable.

**3. Features (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)**
- **Task Management:**
    - **Create Task:**
        - **Expected Behavior:**
            - User can input a task title in a designated text field.
            - User can optionally input a task description in a separate text area.
            - User can optionally select a due date using a date picker.
            - Clicking an "Add Task" or similar button saves the task to the database.
            - The input fields are cleared after a task is successfully added.
            - If the title is missing or contains only whitespace, an error message is displayed, and the task is not added.
    - **View Tasks:**
        - **Expected Behavior:**
            - All tasks are displayed in a list format upon loading the application, ordered by creation date (newest first).
            - Each task item clearly displays its title.
            - Each task item visually indicates its completion status (e.g., checkbox, strikethrough for completed tasks).
            - If there are no tasks, a message indicating an empty list is shown.
    - **Update Task:**
        - **Expected Behavior:**
            - User can initiate an edit mode for a specific task (e.g., by clicking an "Edit" button).
            - In edit mode, the task's title, description, and due date become editable fields, pre-filled with current values.
            - Clicking a "Save" or similar button updates the task in the database.
            - User can cancel the edit operation, reverting to the display mode without saving changes.
            - If the title is cleared or contains only whitespace during an edit, an error message is displayed, and the change is not saved.
    - **Mark as Complete/Incomplete:**
        - **Expected Behavior:**
            - User can toggle the completion status of a task (e.g., by clicking a checkbox).
            - When a task is marked as complete, its appearance changes (e.g., strikethrough title).
            - When a task is marked as incomplete, it reverts to the appearance of an active task.
            - The change in completion status is updated in the database.
    - **Delete Task:**
        - **Expected Behavior:**
            - User can permanently remove a task from the list (e.g., by clicking a "Delete" button).
            - Upon deletion, the task is removed from the displayed list and the database.
- **User Interface (UI):**
    - Clean, minimalist design.
    - Input field for adding new tasks.
    - List display for tasks.
    - Controls (buttons/icons) for editing, deleting, and marking tasks as complete/incomplete.
- **Data Persistence:**
    - All tasks will be saved in a MongoDB database.
    - Task status and details will be retrieved from the database upon loading the application.

**4. Technical Specifications**
- **Frontend:** React
    - Component-based architecture.
    - State management (e.g., React Context API or simple component state).
    - HTTP client (e.g. `fetch` API) for communicating with the backend.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
    - RESTful API endpoints for task operations:
        - `POST /tasks` - Create a new task
        - `GET /tasks` - Retrieve all tasks
        - `GET /tasks/:id` - Retrieve a single task (optional for MVP)
        - `PUT /tasks/:id` - Update an existing task
        - `DELETE /tasks/:id` - Delete a task
    - JSON for request and response bodies.
    - Backend performs basic input validation.
- **Database:** MongoDB
    - Mongoose ODM for interacting with MongoDB.
    - Task schema will include:
        - `title` (String, required)
        - `description` (String, optional)
        - `dueDate` (Date, optional)
        - `isCompleted` (Boolean, default: false)
- **Environment Variables:**
    - Configuration for database connection URI and server port will be managed through environment variables.

**5. User Interface (UI) and Navigation Flow (MVP)**

The application will function as a Single Page Application (SPA).

**I. Main Screen/Page: Task Dashboard**
This is the central screen for the MVP. It will contain:
1.  **Header:** Displays the application name.
2.  **Task Input Area:**
    *   Text field for `Task Title` (required).
    *   Text area for `Task Description` (optional).
    *   Date picker for `Due Date` (optional).
    *   "Add Task" button.
3.  **Task List Area:**
    *   Displays existing tasks.
    *   If no tasks, shows a message like "Your to-do list is empty!".
    *   Each task item will display:
        *   Checkbox to mark as complete/incomplete.
        *   Task Title (strikethrough when complete).
        *   "Edit" button/icon.
        *   "Delete" button/icon.

**II. Navigation Flows & Interactions**
1.  **App Load:**
    *   The app loads and makes an API call to `GET /tasks`.
    *   Tasks are displayed in the "Task List Area".
2.  **Adding a New Task:**
    *   User fills input fields and clicks "Add Task."
    *   API call to `POST /tasks`. On success, the task list is updated and input fields are cleared.
3.  **Marking a Task as Complete/Incomplete:**
    *   User clicks a task's checkbox.
    *   API call to `PUT /tasks/:id` with the updated `isCompleted` status. On success, the task's appearance is updated.
4.  **Editing a Task:**
    *   User clicks "Edit" on a task, transforming it into an editable form with "Save" and "Cancel" buttons.
    *   **Saving:** User clicks "Save," triggering an API call to `PUT /tasks/:id`. On success, the task updates to view-only mode.
    *   **Canceling:** User clicks "Cancel," and the form reverts to view-only mode.
5.  **Deleting a Task:**
    *   User clicks "Delete" on a task.
    *   API call to `DELETE /tasks/:id`. On success, the task is removed from the list.

**6. UI Component Suggestions (for Task Dashboard)**
These are suggestions for a React-based frontend.
1.  **Overall Page Structure:** A main container `<div>` using CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout.
2.  **Header/App Title:** A `<header>` containing an `<h1>`.
3.  **Task Input Area:** A `<form>` wrapping the inputs and the submit button.
    *   **Task Title:** `<input type="text">`
    *   **Task Description:** `<textarea>`
    *   **Due Date:** `<input type="date">`
    *   **Button:** `<button type="submit">Add Task</button>`
4.  **Task List Area:**
    *   **List Container:** `<ul>` or a `<div>`.
    *   **Empty List Message:** A `<p>` tag.
    *   **Task Item (Reusable Component):**
        *   **Container:** An `<li>` or `<div>`.
        *   **Controls:** `<input type="checkbox">`, `<button>Edit</button>`, `<button>Delete</button>`.
        *   **Display:** `<span>` or `<p>` for the title.
5.  **Inline Edit Form (Conditional):** Reuses input components from the "Task Input Area," pre-filled with task data.

**(Styling Note:** CSS will be used for styling. Icon libraries can be considered for buttons).

**7. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for MVP)**
- User Authentication & Authorization.
- Task prioritization, categories, or tags.
- Due date reminders or notifications.
- Advanced sorting and filtering.
- Drag-and-drop reordering.
- Responsive design for mobile devices.
- User accounts and data isolation.
